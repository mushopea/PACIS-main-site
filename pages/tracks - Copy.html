	  <h2>Description:</h2>
	  <p>Knowledge has  been becoming one of the most important strategic assets for organizations in  the 21st Century, and the effective management of knowledge is also widely  considered an important factor that can help organizations sustain competitive  advantage in volatile environments. In organizations, knowledge management (KM)  process always involves the knowledge creation, knowledge storage/retrieval,  knowledge transfer, and knowledge application. </p>
	  <p>Previous research has identified  a series of interesting findings, like what factors influence organizations  adopt information technology in managing knowledge; how information technology  matches with the resources of an organization, thus leading to better  performance; how the network of employees in a company affect knowledge  transfer and management; the effect of employees&rsquo; knowledge sharing on  organization performance, and so on. </p>
	  <p>However, there are still other related  issues less concerned, e.g., knowledge management in small medium enterprises  (SMEs). In addition, the landscape of knowledge management is also changing  rapidly, such as emerging technologies used in knowledge management. This track  welcomes submissions reflecting a breadth research traditions and approaches  and addressing new and emerging issues in the KM field.</p>

	  <h2>Description:</h2>
	    <p>Cultural issues have become increasingly pertinent as  organizations expand globally to seek new markets and tap into global talent  pools. From the perspective of global market expansion, the same IS offering or  the same means of digital communication may be perceived differently by  consumers in different cultures, which in turn impact strategic and financial  outcomes. At most times, IS need to be designed, implemented, and managed with  sensitivity to culture. From the angle of global talent pools, within organizations,  culture (and sub-cultures) play an important role in employees&rsquo; day-to-day  operations involving IS. </p>
	    <p>As an increasing number of organisations rely on  sophisticated IS to plan and execute global business strategies, to manage  projects, and to train employees among other activities, the process of  developing and implementing such systems has clearly an intimate, dynamic  relationship with the values, beliefs, and norms held by multi-cultural  employees. </p>
	    <p>Despite the continued interest in the concept of &lsquo;culture&rsquo; within  the IS community, our understanding of the nature and consequences of the  important relationship between culture and consumers&rsquo; reaction, as well as  between culture and employees&rsquo; productivity remains at a nascent stage. </p>
	    <p>This  track welcomes conceptual and empirical papers, which focus on how culture  (e.g., national, organizational, occupational etc.) relates to the management  of commercial IS or organisational IS, particularly when the systems in  question span geographical boundaries.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Topics of Interest:</p></h2>
	  <p>Suggested topics for papers include, but  are not limited to:<br>
	    â¢Â Â Â Â  Virtual collaboration and  national culture<br>
	    â¢Â Â Â Â  Cultural barriers to IS  implementation<br>
	    â¢Â Â Â Â  Methods for studying cultural  impacts of IS<br>

	    Over the last several years, the adoption of social  media strategies has been rapidly accelerating, with profound impacts being  felt by all sectors of society. Today, the large majority of Fortune 100  companies is active in one or more social media channels. Many companies adopt  and use social media to accomplish a range of business objectives, such as  sales growth, customer relationship, brand building, and customer base  expansion. Some companies are also experimenting with various social media  platforms and tools to improve their business performance in a fundamentally  new way.	    </p>
	  <p>Correspondingly, new social media providers, platforms  and applications appear and are applied at an astonishing rate. It becomes very  important for researchers and practitioners to understand how social media are  applied, how they impact and transform business, as well as how they affect  customers, employees, and other stakeholders.Â  </p>
	  <p> This track welcomes research that provides fresh  theoretical perspectives and novel empirical insights on social media and  business impact.Â  It is a forum for  exchange of research ideas and best practices related to the latest  developments in social media, as well as the challenges of social media use in  business. Our definition of social media is broad. It is not limited to  traditional social network sites such as Facebook, but includes a wider  perspective that includes user-to-user, firm-to-user, and mobile  communities.Â  This track is open to all  types of research, conceptual or empirical.

	    <p>Given that the future of the  global ecosystem and society is dependent on society's collective ability to  reverse or limit the effects of global climate change, economies, organizations  and communities are expected to act in an environmentally sustainable manner  balancing economic outcomes with environmental and social considerations.  Furthermore, sustainability encompasses environmental concerns including  people, processes, technology, and systems to support individual,  organizational, and societal objectives.
  </p>
	      </p>
	    <p>The information system (IS) discipline  engages with the development of environmentally sustainable social and business  practices through IS practice and research- commonly known as green information  technology (IT) and green IS. Green IT/IS and sustainability have increasingly  become important issues for business in this era of climate change and scarce  resources. Green IT refers to computing technologies that are energy-efficient  and have minimal adverse impact on the environment.Â  It also includes the beliefs and actions of  IT professionals in preventing pollution, improving product stewardship, and  contributing to sustainable development.Â   Green IS covers IS solutions that mitigate the challenges of climate  change and other environmental problems.Â  </p>
	    <p>The salience of technology and systems in shaping organizations and  society suggests that green IT/IS is a key component of an organization's  environmental initiatives. Beyond the role of reducing the environmental  footprint of technologies, green ISÂ  can  be initiated, adapted, and implemented toÂ   play a key role in supporting sustainable business practices, e.g., in  reducing consumption and facilitating reuse and recycle. </p>
	  <p>This track focuses on  the role of IT/IS in supporting sustainability initiatives and in balancing the  need for profitability versus the need to address environmental concerns.<br>

	    The use of information systems  (IS) has permeated all facets of the society and presents researchers with  unique opportunities to examine the intertwining relationship of technology and  people. Human behavior and its impacts emerge in every stage of the IS  lifecycle. To achieve a more comprehensive and universal understanding of the  IS applications in various contexts, we need to delve into the diversified  manifestations and dynamics of human interactions with different types of IS,  as well as the relationships between human behavior and performance.  Particularly, the emerging technologies bring up a series of new issues that  challenge researchers to think about the changing nature of the interplay  between IS and human behavior. <br>
	    This track invites submissions  that focus on the human behavioral aspects of IS. We particularly welcome  papers that draw on interdisciplinary perspectives to rejuvenate our  understanding of how the use of IS alters human behaviors and how IS design,  development, deployment, adoption, implementation, and continuous usage are  influenced by human actions.

	  <h2>Description:</h2>
	    Human-computer  interaction (HCI) is an interdisciplinary area that has attracted researchers,  educators, and practitioners from different disciplines. It essentially deals  with the design, evaluation, adoption, and use of information technology, with  a common focus on improving user performance and experience. New and exciting  research opportunities are emerging, including issues and challenges concerning  people&rsquo;s interactions with various information technologies that can be  examined from an organizational, managerial, psychological, social, or cultural  perspective. To better utilize today&rsquo;s information technologies, we need to  better understand users, their tasks within different contexts, and the  interplay among users, tasks, and contexts/environments. This track welcomes  research papers that aim at advancing our understanding of humanâcomputer interaction at an individual, work group,  organizational, or societal level. Papers may use any research methods, and we  particularly welcome controversial pieces that will challenge taken-for-granted  assumptions, existing models, and current research practices.<br>

	    Information technology (IT) has been seen to be key in  improving healthcare service quality, controlling healthcare cost, and  alleviating societal challenges. In recent years, many healthcare institutions  in both private and public sectors have made considerable investments in a  multitude of healthcare systems to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes  within and across institutional settings. Patients and health consumers are  also increasingly being exposed to health-related digital platforms, such as  online health communities and social media that have emerged and proliferated  as alternative sources of health information and social support. Despite the  abundant investment and the rapid growth, the healthcare IT industry still  faces many challenges pertaining to the behavioral, technological and economic  issues. The difficulty of achieving the effectiveness of HIT in Asia Pacific is  further heightened with the diversified healthcare structures and culture in  this region. In this track we welcome papers that focus on the behavioral,  technological and/or economic aspects of Health IT. </p>

	  <h2>Description:</h2>
	    Enterprise System (ES), as one of  the most costly IT innovation investment by a corporation, has undergone  significant development in the last two decades. As a large-scale, integrated  software package, ES simplifies, coordinates and manages almost all the  business processes and information flow across multiple business units (e.g.  accounting, marketing, manufacturing and logistics) and subsidiaries, which has  resulted in a systematic management of the workflow processes within a  corporation. ES has developed, over the years, from providing back office  services (known as Enterprise Resource Planning system) to affording front  office and inter-organizational services (such as Customer Relationship  Management and value-chain systems).<br>
	    Today, ES is facing new emerging  challenges with corporations need to be more innovative in managing their  enterprise systems and be more cautious in streamline their business processes.  Newer ES features, such as Cloud ERP computing, web services (e.g., web 2.0  role in ES), high-performance analytics appliance (e.g., SAP HANA), and mobile applications  are explored to accelerate key business process, speed up decision making, and  achieve higher customers engagement for maximized revenue and productivity. The  rapid technological development of ES and its indispensable role in  organizations warrant novel and forward-looking papers.<br>
	    Indeed, while a large body of  knowledge related to modeling, designing, and executing business processes  exists, ES and its management of business processes need to deviate from the  'classical' information systems research approach. We welcome papers that adopt  conceptual and empirical researches representing all ontological perspectives.  We particularly encourage submissions that propose and critically evaluate new  ways of thinking about business processes, system development, and innovative  enterprise architecture. Our intention is to provide a forum to bridging both  researchers and educators with alike interests to (a) share their current work  and plan future directions for the field, and (b) stimulate future collaborations  in research.</p>
