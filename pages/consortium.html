        Nominations are invited for the 19th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS) 2015 Doctoral Consortium. The Consortium will be held on July 5-6 at University Town (U-Town) at the National University of Singapore, immediately prior to the PACIS 2015 Conference.
        
        <P><br><h2>Call for Nominations</h2>
        
        Universities are invited to nominate candidates for the consortium. Eligible candidates are Ph.D. students in Information Systems (IS), who have developed a plan for pursuing their dissertation, and would benefit from constructive feedback from senior faculty in the field. The consortium aims to provide doctoral students with an opportunity to share their research ideas and network with peers and experienced scholars serving as faculty advisors. Participating students will receive high quality feedback from faculty advisors, who are eminent researchers in the field, associated with leading institutions around the globe, serving in senior editorial positions in the field’s top journals. This consortium will be a significant event for emerging IS researchers in the Asia Pacific region.
        
        <P><br><h2>Nomination Eligibility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Ph.D. students who are currently  working on a doctoral dissertation in Information Systems, and whose research  has progressed to the point where a clear plan of investigation has been laid  out, but there is sufficient scope for changes to this plan based on feedback  from the consortium.</li><P></P>
          <li>The ideal consortium candidate  should have chosen a theoretical approach and initiated planning or  implementation of empirical work, but should have at least six months of work  remaining at the time of the consortium.</li><P></P>
          <li>The nominated candidates must be  sufficiently proficient in English to participate in the consortium, since the  language of the consortium will be English.</li><P></P>
          <li>While priority will be given to  students from institutions in the Asia-Pacific region (AIS Region 3), applicants  from other AIS regions will be considered subject to spare seats.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
        <p><br><h2>Nomination Process</h2></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the interests of diversity and  equity, more than one nomination is allowed from any single institution, but we  require that the nominees be ranked. Note that the first-ranked nominees will  have equal chance against other top ranked or sole nominees. The 2nd ranked  nominees would only be considered after all 1st ranked/sole nominees.</li><P></P>
          <li>Students must be nominated by an  IS faculty member. The nomination should follow the guidelines below:</li><P></P>
          <ul>
            <li>A submitted proposal should  outline the research topic, research question(s), theoretical foundations,  proposed methodology, current stage of the research, and plans for completion.</li>
            <li>The proposal should meet the  requirements of research-in-progress (RIP) submissions for PACIS, since  accepted proposals will be published in the conference proceedings as RIP  papers.</li>
            <li>The proposal must not exceed 7  single-spaced A4 pages (12-point Times New Roman font, 1 inch spacing on all  sides) and must conform to the Research-In-Progress word template (available  for download from the PACIS 2015 website). The 7 pages must include all text,  figures, tables, and appendices, but exclude the cover page, abstract,  keywords, and references. Please note that the length restriction is strict;  proposals that do not follow the requirements will not be considered.</li>
            <li>A cover page should show the  candidate&rsquo;s full name, affiliation (university and school/department), and all  contact details including name, mailing and e-mail addresses, and telephone and  fax numbers. The candidate should also indicate the name(s) of his or her  principal faculty supervisors.</li>
            <li>A nomination letter from either  the director of the IS doctoral program, the IS department&rsquo;s chairperson, or  the candidate&rsquo;s thesis/dissertation advisor should certify that that the  candidate is the nominee from the university/institution, and that the  candidate meets the eligibility criteria mentioned above.</li>
            <li>A completed <a href="../_files/PACIS2015_DC_Nomination.doc">Nomination Information Sheet</a></li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p><br><h2>Consortium Schedule</h2> 
Consortium activities will commerce with  Registration and Panel in the afternoon on Sunday, 5th July, followed by a  welcome dinner. Full day event is scheduled all day on the 6th July, which will  focus on providing constructive feedback to students on their research.<br><br>
The Consortium will include a balanced mix of  students representing diverse research topics, methods, schools and cultures.  The number of attendees will be limited to 20, organized into 4 streams of 5  students. Each student will present his or her research in a designated stream  led by 2-3 faculty advisors, who will have carefully reviewed the student  submissions. Participants are required to have carefully reviewed all proposals  in their stream prior to the Consortium so that they are prepared to contribute  to the discussion on each student&rsquo;s research.<br>


<p><br><h2>Registration and Cost</h2> 
Accepted consortium students are required to  register for the main PACIS conference by the early-bird date.  The students will receive further feedback by  presenting their research during a poster session.<br><br>
There is no registration fee for the doctoral  consortium and lodging will be provided during the consortium (i.e., 1-night  stay at U-Town on July 5, 2015). Transport from NUS U-Town to Marina Bay Sands  at the conclusion of the consortium is also provided.  However, the students are responsible for  their own travel (e.g., airfare, transport to NUS U-Town) and accommodations  during the main PACIS conference.   Nominating institutions are encouraged to provide financial assistance  to successful nominees in the form of travel and accommodation aid. More  detailed information about the consortium will be provided on acceptance.<br>

          <ul>
